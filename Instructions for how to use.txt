< Overview >a) Functionality:- This Python program allows you to automatically make payments to your participants (MTurk workers) using an official AWS SDK.- To accomplish it, the program requires session-data (.csv) files generated by SaveDataFile.php (see https://github.com/ToshiEAB/Amazon-Mechanical-Turk-Tutorial)
b) Installation and how to use- Read Steps below*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***The copyright holder of this program has no liability regarding issues resulting from potential bugs in this program.You could pay a bonus to a wrong MTurk worker or pay a wrong bonus amount.Thus, use this program at your own risk!If you can take the risk, then I recommend starting with a small set of .csv data files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Install Anaconda
Anaconda allows you to:- write programs in Python- use many useful packages/libraries for programming- create virtual environments, which helps protecting your computer system when installing/uninstalling packages
1) Follow instructions at: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html- Select an instruction that matches your operating system (e.g., Windows)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Install AWS SDK (boto3)
1) Open a Terminal (Command-line console)	- Windows: Open "Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)" -- an app/software that comes with Anaconda	- Mac: Search for 'Terminal' in Finder and open that application	- Linux: Press Ctrl+Alt+T
2) Type the following on Terminalconda create -n awsSDK python=3.7conda activate awsSDK
Notes:- First line:	This will create a virtual environment named "awsSDK" along with Python version 3.7.		You likely need to hit the "y" key (meaning "yes") during the installation.- Second line:	This will activate the virtual environment.
3) On Terminal, change the directory/folder to the one where you wanna save AWS SDK
Notes:- Use the "cd" command for changing the directory on Terminal- Hereafter, I assume that you save the SDK in the PyCharmProjects folder created when installing PyCharm. Thus,	- Windows: cd C:\Users\username\PyCharmProjects		(Note: Replace "username" with your own username on your computer)	- Mac: cd PyCharmProjects	- Linux: cd ~/PyCharmProjects
4) Download AWS SDK (boto3) by typing the following on Terminalgit clone https://github.com/boto/boto3.git
Notes:- The above command assumes that "git" has been installed on your computer.- Alternatively, you can manually download the SDK as a .zip folder from from: https://github.com/boto/boto3	- Click the "Code" button & Select "Download ZIP"	- Extract the .zip folder and move the entire extracted folder to the PyCharmProjects (see "3)")
5) Change the SDK's folder name to "boto3" (I assume you do this for the instructions below)

6) Install the SDK while being in the PyCharmProjects directory on Terminalcd boto3python -m pip install -r requirements.txtpython -m pip install -e .python -m pip install boto3
Notes:- First line: Move to the directory where you see "requirements.txt"- Second to fourth lines: Install the SDK along with its dependencies	- Don't forget to type "." after "-e"
7) Check if the SDK has been installed by typingconda list
Notes:- You should see "boto3" in the list
8) Close the Terminal---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Install PyCharmPyCharm allows you to:	- use virtual environments created with Anaconda	- write Python programs	- debug the program	Note: You don't need PyCharm to run a Python program but I hereafter assume you install it. 
1) Follow instructions at: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html	- Select an instruction that matches your operating system (e.g., Windows)	- Free (Community) version will suffice
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Create a new project on PyCharm
1) See general instructions at: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-empty-project.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: Set up for using the Python program for making payments
1) Download my Python program and its associated files by typing the following on Terminalgit clone https://github.com/ToshiEAB/make_payment_with_AWS_SDK.gitNotes:- The above command assumes that "git" has been installed on your computer.- Alternatively, you can manually download the program as a .zip folder from: https://github.com/ToshiEAB/make_payment_with_AWS_SDK	- Click the "Code" button & Select "Download ZIP" & Extract the folder and move it to the PyCharmProjects folder
2) Create a new directory/folder named ".aws" in the following directory:	- Windows: C:\Users\username\		(Note: Replace "username" with your own username on your computer)	- Mac: /Users/username/			(Note: Replace "username" with your own username on your computer)	- Linux: /home/username/		(Note: Replace "username" with your own username on your computer)Notes:- There is a dot "." before "aws"- When running the Python program, the SDK will automatically search the ".aws" folder in the above directory.3) Move "config" and "credentials" files in "move these files to .aws folder" to the ".aws" folder you have just created above.4) Edit the "credentials" file (You can open it as a text file)
Notes:- You can get your own "aws_access_key_id" and "aws_secret_access_key" from your aws account:
	- Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. 
	- In the navigation bar on the upper right, choose your account name or number and then choose My Security Credentials.
	- Expand the Access keys (access key ID and secret access key) section.
	- To create an access key, choose Create New Access Key. 		- If you already have two access keys, this button is disabled and you must delete an access key before you can create a new one. 	- When prompted, choose either Show Access Key or Download Key File. This is your only opportunity to save your secret access key. After you've saved your secret access key in a secure location, chose Close.- *** IMPORTANT ***: These keys are alternatives to your HIT password and so don't share them with anyone.
5) Optionally, edit the "config" file located in the ".aws" folder
Notes:- Most likely you don't have to edit this file but you may have to depending on where you reside6) Edit the "config.ini" file (You can open it as a text file)
Notes:- You can get "hitID" (i.e., HIT ID) from your HIT account.- The Python program will read the "config.ini" file when you run it
7) Move session-data files (.csv files) to the "mturk_data" folder
Notes:- The "mturk_data" folder has a dummy data file (You should delete it after testing the program)
- The .csv file must include the following two lines:
	- completion code: 	- TotalPayment: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6: Use the Python program
1) Double-click main.py to open it with PyCharm
2) Select the "awsSDK" virtual environment (see https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html#existing-environment)
3) Adjust the value of "BASE_PAY_IN_DOLLAR" in the Python code
*** IMPORTANT NOTES ***:
- This is the base amount of money that all participants will receive.  Thus, this value must match the one you enter on your HIT page (as well as the variable named "basePay" in the "session" JavaScript program).   When logged in to your MTurk Requester page, this is the amount you enter under Create-->Edit Project-->Reward per response.- The "bonus" that you will pay is equal to "TotalPayment" minus "BASE_PAY_IN_DOLLAR"
4) Run the program- Initially, "TEST = True" in order to skip the actual payment process as a safeguard.   Change it to "False" when you are ready for making payments actually.- The Python program will access AWS to get information from your HIT including SurveyCode.   Set up your HIT page using the "Survey Link" template under "Create" on your MTurk Requester page.   Participants will enter the SurveyCode below the link to the experiment webpage on that template.
